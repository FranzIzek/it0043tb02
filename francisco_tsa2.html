            <h2>DEPED SUSPENDS F2F CLASSES DUE TO HEAT, PUJ STRIKE</h2>
            <p>MANILA, Philippines — Onsite classes in public schools have been suspended today and tomorrow due to the
                extreme heat forecast nationwide and the transport strike, according to the Department of Education
                (DepEd).

                “In view of the latest heat index forecast of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical
                Services Administration and the announcement of a nationwide transport strike, all public schools
                nationwide shall implement asynchronous classes/distance learning on April 29 and 30, 2024,” DepEd said
                yesterday.</p>
            <p>MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine government must review the public utility vehicle modernization
                program (PUVMP) and its impact on the livelihood of drivers, operators and their families, according to
                several business and workers’ groups.

                “We call for an urgent review of the PUVMP in order to address its legal, financial and human rights
                infirmities,” the Leaders Forum said yesterday in a joint statement.

                The groups also called for the suspension of the consolidation deadline for an indefinite period and the
                creation of “an affordable, sustainable and carbon-neutral mass transport system.”
